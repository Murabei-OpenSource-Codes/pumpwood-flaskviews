# Description
This package assist the creation of views in flask using Pumpwood pattern.

# Enviroment variables
- **PUMPWOOD_FLASKVIEWS__INFO_CACHE_TIMEOUT (int):** Default to 10 minutes (600),
  this cache timeout is used for some how static information on the system such
  as description of the fields and it's components
- **PUMPWOOD_FLASKVIEWS__SERIALIZER_FK_CACHE_TIMEOUT (int):** Default to 5
  minutes (300), this cache timeout is used to reduce microservice call to
  bring foreign_key objects that might be present on other services on retrieve
  and list calls. Used on `MicroserviceForeignKeyField` field.

## pumpwood_flaskviews.action
Expose models functions at the API. It is possible to expose normal and
classmethods, the first argument for each one should respect the convention
self and cls respectively.

```
from pumpwoodflask_views.action import action


class Person(db.Model):
    """Citizen of a far far way country."""

    name = db.Column(db.String(3), nullable=True, doc=(
        "csv field delimiter when using file input"))
    birth_date = db.DateTime(db.String(3), nullable=True, doc=(
        "csv decimal delimiter when using file input"))

    __tablename__ = 'person'

    @action(info='Marry person to another.')
    def marry(self, person_id: int, contract: str = None) -> bool:
        """
        Marry person to another one.

        Args
        ----
        person_id: int
          Id of the person to whom the object should be married.

        Kwargs
        ----------
        contract: str
          Set the legal contract used.

        Returns
        -------
        bool
            Returns true if it was possible to process the action.
        """
        ...
        return True

    @classmethod
    @action(info='Send cards to today's birthday.')
    def process_birthday_cards(cls, reference_date: datetime.datetime) -> int:
        """
        Send birthday cards to every one with birthday today. If reference_date
        if reference_date is passed it will be used instead of today as
        reference.

        Args
        ----
        No args.

        Kwargs
        ----------
        reference_date: datetime.datetime
          Reference date to check for birthdays.

        Returns
        -------
        int
            Number of birthday cards sent.
        """
        ...
        return True
```

```
from pumpwood_communication.microservices import PumpWoodMicroService

microservice = PumpWoodMicroService(
    server_url="http://0.0.0.0:8080/",
    username="pumpwood", password="pumpwood")
microservice.login()

# List the actions avaiable for the model Person, it will include information
# about the parameters and also the doc string associated with the function.
person_actions = microservice.list_actions(model_class="Person")

# Return the serialized person object, the parameters used at the action and
# the result
results = microservice.excute_action(
  model_class="Person", pk=3, action="marry",
  parameters={"person_id": 1})

# process_birthday_cards is a classfunction so it is not associated with an
# object
microservice.excute_action(
  model_class="Person", action="process_birthday_cards")
```

## pumpwood_flaskviews.auth
Integrate pumpwood authentication with flask end-points. After setting the
Auth host it is possible o call check_authorization, it will pass request
headers to auth end-point and check if user is authenticated.

```
AuthFactory.set_server_url(server_url=config_dict['AUTH_SERVER'])

def flask_end_point():
  AuthFactory.check_authorization()
  return ...
```

## pumpwood_flaskviews.fields
Extend SQLAlchemy fields for some common used fields in Pumpwood.
- GeometryField: Serialize shapely geometry fields.
- ChoiceField: Serialize sqlalchemy_utils ChoiceType fields.


## pumpwood_flaskviews.serializers
Define a base serializer for pumpwood models which always return at least pk
and model_class.

## pumpwood_flaskviews.views
Define pumpwood basic views. They have always the same pattern:


### PumpWoodFlaskView

#### Class Attributes
##### description [str]:
Description of the model, this can be used to display model
navegation on side bar. During call to end-point information
this attribute will be passed to i8s for translation.

##### dimensions [dict]:
Dictionary of tag/value, this will be registred at model class
route.

##### icon [str]:
String setting icon name to be display at the frontend.

##### db [SQLAlchemy Database]:
Connection to database.

##### model_class [SQLAlchemy Model]:
Model class of Flask SQLAlchemy.

##### storage_object [PumpWoodStorage]:
Storage object to connect to S3, blog, GCP storage, etc...

##### microservice [PumpWoodMicroService]:
Microservice used to connect to other microservices in
pumpwood. This microservice must be authenticated.

##### serializer [PumpWoodSerializer]:
Serialize to be used to serialize model objects at end-points.

##### list_fields [list(str)]:
List of fields that will be considered as default to be displayed
when calling list with default fields.

It is possible to modify function `get_list_fields` to make
list_fields to adapt to request.

##### foreign_keys [dict]:
A dictionary to describe relation of this model with other models
in Pumpwood. This is informational data and does nos verify if
model actualy exists on Pumpwood. There are two types of

##### gui_retrieve_fieldset [dict]:
Set a dictionary for rendering frontend, it specify groups of fields to be displayed together. It also permits pass to
front the ordering of the fields. Dictionary structure:

```python
# List of the field sets that will be passed to front-end
# permitting setting them in an order
gui_retrieve_fieldset = [
    {
        # Name of the field set
        "name": "Main",
        # Fields that will be returned on this field set,
        # with permits ordering the fields on front end.
        "fields": ['name', 'birth_date']
    }, {
        # It can be passed many relations such as children_set
        "name": "Relations",
        "fields": ['married_to_id', 'children_set']
    }, {
        "name": "Jobs",
        "fields": ['job_set']
    }
]
```

It is possible to modify function `get_gui_retrieve_fieldset` to make list_fields to adapt to request.

##### gui_verbose_field [str]:
Permit pass to front end how this object should be displayed on
retrieve view. It is set to substitute using data from the model,
example:
```python
# This will help front end to display title of retrieve page
# as '5 | Jonh Doe' substituting values os pk and name.
gui_verbose_field = '{pk} | {name}'

```

It is possible to modify function `get_gui_verbose_field` to make list_fields to adapt to request.

##### gui_readonly [list(str)]:
Set a list of fields that will be considered as read-only on
front-end, but can be modified using API. This is useful since
some data might be only modified thought API such as jobs start
and end time.

```python
# This will set birth_date as read-only on field description,
# although it is still possible to modify it using the API
gui_readonly = ["birth_date"]
```

It is possible to modify function `get_gui_readonly` to make list_fields to adapt to request.

#### End-points
- list (/rest/[model_class]/list/): List objects using query parameters
    passed as dictionary payload, paginate by 50.
- list_without_pag (/rest/[model_class]/list-without-pag/): Same as list,
    but return all objects.
- list_one (/rest/[model_class]/list-one/): List one object using list
    serialize (fewer fields).
- retrieve (/rest/[model_class]/retrieve/[pk]): Return all information from
    one object.
- object_template (/rest/[model_class]/retrieve/): Return an empty object
  template.
- retrieve_file (/rest/[model_class]/retrieve-file/[pk]?file-field=[field]):
    retrieve file which path is saved on file-field argument.
- remove_file_field (/rest/[model_class]/remove-file-field/[pk]?file-field=[field]):
    delete file  which path is saved on file-field argument using streaming.
- retrieve_file_streaming (/rest/[model_class]/retrieve-file-streaming/[pk]?file-field=[field]):
  retrieve file which path is saved on file-field argument using streaming.
- save_file_streaming (/rest/[model_class]/save-file-streaming/[pk]?file-field=[field]):
  Save a file in file-field using streaming.
- save (/rest/[model_class]/save/) Save file object passed in payload.
- delete (/rest/[model_class]/delete/[pk]): Remove an object from database.
- delete_many (/rest/[model_class]/delete/): Delete many objects using
  query dictionary.
- list_actions (/rest/[model_class]/actions/): List actions available for
  model_class.
- execute_action (/rest/[model_class]/actions/[action name]/[pk]): Run action
    over object pk.
- search_options (/rest/[model_class]/options/): Retrieve information for
    list fields and filters.
- fill_options (/rest/[model_class]/options/): Pass an incomplete object as
    post payload and receives the validation of the fields and update the
    choice possibilities.

<b>PumpWoodDataFlaskView</b>
- Same as PumpWoodFlaskView...
- pivot (/rest/[model_class]/pivot/): Retrieve data using query dict, but
    instead of using serializers use pandas data frame and parse result with
    to_dict. It is possible to pivot data using the columns.
- bulk_save (/rest/[model_class]/bulk-save/): Bulck save data on database.

<b>PumpWoodDimentionsFlaskView</b>
- Same as PumpWoodFlaskView...
- list_dimentions (/rest/[model_class]/list-dimentions/): List avaiable
    dimentions in objects resulting from the query.
- list_dimention_values (/rest/[model_class]/list-dimention-values/): List
    values associated with dimentions in objects resulting from the query.

Example for defining a PumpWoodFlaskView:
```python
from pumpwoodflask_views.views import PumpWoodFlaskView
from models import Person
from serializers import PersonSerializer
from singletons import storage_object, microservice


class PersonView(PumpWoodFlaskView):
    description = "Person"

    # Used when registering end-point on routes
    dimentions = {
        "service": "test-service",
        "type": "human",
    }
    icon = None

    db = db
    model_class = Person
    storage_object = storage_object
    microservice = microservice
    serializer = PersonSerializer

    foreign_keys = {
        'married_to_id': {
          'model_class': 'Person', 'many': False,
          'display_field': 'name'}
        'children_set': {
            'model_class': 'Children', 'many': True,
            'foreign_key': 'parent_id', 'read_only': True},
        'job_set': {
            'model_class': 'Job', 'many': True,
            'foreign_key': 'person_id', 'read_only': False},
    }

    #######
    # Gui #
    list_fields = [
        'pk', 'model_class', 'name', 'birthday', 'married_to_id']
    gui_retrieve_fieldset = [
        {
            "name": "Main",
            "fields": ['name', 'birth_date']
        }, {
            "name": "Relations",
            "fields": ['married_to_id', 'children_set']
        }, {
            "name": "Jobs",
            "fields": ['job_set']
        }
    ]
    gui_verbose_field = '{pk} | {name}'
    gui_readonly = ["birth_date"]
    #######
